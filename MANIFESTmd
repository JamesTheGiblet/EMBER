# EMBER - The Universal Life Pattern

**Simple rule: Existence costs energy. Resources provide energy. Survive.**

## What Is EMBER?

EMBER is the fundamental pattern of life, reduced to its absolute minimum and implemented in hardware.

It is not a specific robot. It is a **life template** - the core equation that every living thing follows, whether biological or artificial:
```cpp

energy -= EXISTENCE_COST;
energy += detectResource() * EFFICIENCY;
alive = (energy > 0);

## What Is EMBER?

EMBER is the fundamental pattern of life, reduced to its absolute minimum and implemented in hardware.

It is not a specific robot. It is a **life template** - the core equation that every living thing follows, whether biological or artificial:
```cpp
energy -= EXISTENCE_COST;
energy += detectResource() * EFFICIENCY;
alive = (energy > 0);
```

Everything else - movement, sensing, communication, cooperation, competition, speciation - emerges from this foundation when you add complexity. But the foundation itself never changes.

EMBER is where artificial life begins.

## The Core Equation

All life faces the same problem:

1. **Existence has a cost** - You lose energy just by being alive
2. **Resources exist in the environment** - But you must detect them
3. **Conversion efficiency varies** - Genes determine how well you extract energy
4. **Survival is mathematical** - `resource_gain > existence_cost`

This is true for:
- Plants (light → chemical energy)
- Animals (food → metabolic energy)  
- Bacteria (nutrients → survival)
- EMBER bots (sensors → electrical energy)

The **sensor changes**. The **equation doesn't**.

---

## Why This Matters

### 1. It's Universal

EMBER works with ANY resource detection mechanism:
- Light sensor → phototroph (survives near light)
- Sound sensor → phonotroph (survives near sound)
- Temperature sensor → thermotroph (survives near heat)
- Chemical sensor → chemotroph (survives near food)
- Proximity sensor → tactilotroph (survives near objects)

The life logic is identical. Only `detectResource()` changes.

### 2. It Enables Evolution

Because survival depends on the genome (threshold, efficiency), natural selection works:
- Random variation in genes
- Environmental selection pressure
- Fittest genomes survive longest
- Copy successful genes to next generation
- Add small mutations
- Repeat

**You can watch evolution happen in real-time.**

### 3. It Produces Emergence

When multiple EMBER bots with different genomes compete for the same resources:
- Specialists emerge (optimized for one resource)
- Generalists emerge (survive anywhere, excel nowhere)
- Niche partitioning emerges (different bots occupy different spaces)
- Communication strategies emerge (cooperation beats competition)
- **None of this is programmed. It emerges from the core equation.**

## The Mavric Pattern in Hardware

EMBER demonstrates the three-layer emergence architecture (Mavric Pattern) in physical form:

**Layer 1: Physics**
- Light hits sensor → voltage change
- Current flows through LED → photons emitted
- Energy stored in system → state maintained

**Layer 2: Life**
- Sensor reading → resource detection
- Energy management → survival state
- Genome parameters → individual variation

**Layer 3: Evolution**
- Fitness measurement → survival time
- Genetic variation → different parameters
- Selection pressure → environmental fit
- **Emergent behaviors:** specialization, cooperation, adaptation

Each layer follows **simple rules**. Complexity emerges at layer boundaries.

## Design Philosophy

### Anti-Gatekeeping
All EMBER designs, code, and documentation are MIT licensed. No secrets. No paywalls. Anyone can build, modify, and extend EMBER organisms.

### Minimal Viable Complexity
EMBER uses the **smallest possible rule set** that produces the desired emergence. If you can remove a rule without losing the core behavior, remove it.

### Build To Understand
EMBER isn't a simulation. It's physical hardware following real physical laws. The goal is to **prove emergence works in reality**, not just in theory.

### Evolution Over Programming
Don't program behaviors. Program the **capacity for behaviors to evolve**. If you find yourself writing `if (situation) then (specific_action)`, you're doing it wrong. Write the fitness function and let natural selection find the solution.

## The Experiment

### Basic Setup
1. Build 9 EMBER v0.1 bots
2. Give each a unique `bot_id` (0-8)
3. Flash with identical code but randomized genomes
4. Place in shared environment with light source
5. **Watch which ones survive**

### What You'll See
- Some bots thrive (green LED, high energy)
- Some bots struggle (red flashing, low energy)
- Some bots die (LED off, energy = 0)

### The Pattern
- Bots with `light_threshold` **below** ambient light level → survive
- Bots with `light_threshold` **above** ambient light level → die
- Bots with high `efficiency` → gain more from same light
- **The environment selects which genomes survive**

### Evolution Loop
1. Run for 10 minutes (or until deaths occur)
2. Record fitness (alive_time) for each bot
3. Identify the 3 longest-surviving genomes
4. Copy their genes to the dead bots
5. Add small random mutations (±10%)
6. Reset energy, restart experiment
7. **Repeat**

After 10 generations, your bot population will be **adapted to your specific light environment**. Different lighting = different optimal genomes.

## Why "EMBER"?

An ember is:
- **Small** - Minimal viable life
- **Energy** - Glowing with stored heat
- **Potential** - Can ignite into raging fire
- **Fragile** - Dies without fuel
- **Reproductive** - One ember can create many

Like a real ember, EMBER organisms:
- Start simple and small
- Require constant energy to survive  
- Can grow into complex systems (swarms)
- Die if resources run out
- Can spread and multiply when conditions are right

From tiny ember → raging fire.  
From simple organism → artificial ecosystem.

## Connection to Forge Theory

EMBER is **Forge Theory in silicon**.

Every Forge simulation demonstrates:
- Simple rules → complex behavior
- Local interactions → global patterns
- Random variation → selected adaptation
- Three-layer emergence (physics → life → evolution)

EMBER proves this **works in physical reality**, not just simulation.

When you watch an EMBER bot die in shadow and thrive in light, you're watching the same emergence pattern as:
- TreeForge (cells → branches → forest)
- EcoForge (agents → populations → ecosystems)  
- NeuroForge (neurons → patterns → thought)
- LifeForge (chemistry → cells → organisms)

**The pattern is universal. EMBER is the hardware proof.**

## Getting Started

See:
- `EMBER_v0.1_SPEC.md` - Technical specification for version 0.1
- `EMBER_BUILD_GUIDE.md` - How to build the physical hardware
- `EMBER_EVOLUTION_GUIDE.md` - How to run evolution experiments

Or just flash the code, place it near a window, and watch it live or die.

**That's the whole point.**

## The Question EMBER Answers

**Can artificial life emerge from simple rules in physical hardware?**

Build one. Watch it survive or die based on its genome and environment.

The answer is glowing green in your hand.
